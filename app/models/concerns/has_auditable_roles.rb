module HasAuditableRoles
  extend ActiveSupport::Concern

  # The audit functionality works using ActiveRecord extensions and callbacks,
  # but user roles are managed by the `rolify` gem which doesn't provide
  # an ActiveRecord model for the joining table.
  #
  # The next best thing is to override the `add_role` and `remove_role` methods
  # so that they call the original and then manually create an Audit record.
  #
  # # Notes
  #
  # * The Audit record will reflect an update to the current model since the
  #   joining table has no model that can be referenced.
  #
  # * This approach also queries the joining table twice to get a before/after
  #   count. This isn't ideal but this isn't an action that's performed
  #   frequently enough to worry about it
