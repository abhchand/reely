# Ideally the specs for the `has_synthetic_id` concern would go here, but since
# it relies on a `shared_examples` block rspec complains about it. See:
#
#   https://github.com/rspec/rspec-core/issues/828
#
# To get around this, the shared examples can be found under
# `spec/support/shared_examples/*` instead. This is just an informative
# placeholder
